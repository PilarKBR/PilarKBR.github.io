  [Notebooks (Include Final Project on Startup Campus & Medium Story Needs)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kC1dS0MDsBoOxX-HXtIWr1e7uJVTd_HS?usp=sharing)

  
  Developed objective strategy for Understand customers in depth and identify groups of customers who have similar needs, preferences, or buying behaviors using **RFM Analysis** with then customer segmentating is done using **K-means** and the predicted results of their total spending using **ARIMA** . Cluster results formed from the application of K-means on RFM Scores for this dataset amounted to 5 clusters with different characteristics and recommendations for each cluster.
